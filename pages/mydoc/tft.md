User thro42's version of the [TFT firmware](https://github.com/Thro42/BTT-SOVOL-TouchScreenFirmware-Duet) is currently the most feature complete available. It is based off the work of [jimmymaddness](https://github.com/JimmymaDdness/Mks-TouchScreenFirmware-Duet), which is turn based off the work of [bcmob](https://github.com/bcmob/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware).  

Work is being undertaken to get full RepRapFirmware support in the [standard bigtreetech firmware](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware)
