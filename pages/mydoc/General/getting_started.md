To run this on a supported LPC or STM32 based board, a number of items are required.

## Firmware
A copy of the firmware is required and can be found [here](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/releases) (remember to rename it to just firmware.bin). This is placed on the root of the SD card and is flashed to the board on first boot of the device.  
There are four versions of the firmware (the correct one is identified on each board specific page):  
* LPC-WiFi
* LPC-SBC
* STM32F4-WiFi
* STM32F4-SBC

### WiFi
This version is for use on boards that are going to be used with an ESP8266 WiFi connection. Information can be found on the corresponding boards page.  

### SBC
This version uses an SBC (Single Board Computer) such as a raspberry pi to serve up the webpage, allowing both an ethernet or WiFi connection. This acts in the same way as the new Duet 3 + SBC. Information can be found on the corresponding boards page.  

## SD Card Structure
The SD Card structure as detailed [here](https://docs.duet3d.com/en/User_manual/RepRapFirmware/SD_card).  
This is applicable only to WiFi versions of the firmware.  

## DuetWebControl
The standard version of DuetWebControl (DWC) is now fully compatible with this port.  
It can be found [here](https://github.com/Duet3D/DuetWebControl/releases).  

## Configuration Files
These can be generated by visiting the [Configurator](https://teamgloomy.github.io/Configurator).  
All boards that are currently supported are available on the webpage.  
These should be added to the /sys folder on the SD Card or uploaded via DWC to the SBC.  

## Board.txt file
This needs to be added to the /sys folder on the SD Card for the WiFi and SBC version.  
This can be generated using the [Configurator](https://teamgloomy.github.io/Configurator).  

## Updating
When updating to new versions of the firmware, please read the following files:  
- [Whats new in RRF](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware/wiki/Changelog-RRF-3.x) This details all of the changes made to the RepRapFirmware between each version.  
- [Whats new in RRF - LPC/STM32 Specific - RRF3.3](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/blob/v3.3-dev/WHATS_NEW_UNIFIED.md) or [Whats new in RRF - STM32 Specific - RRF3.4](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/blob/v3.4-dev/WHATS_NEW_UNIFIED.md) This details any specific changes which have been made to RepRapFirmware between each version.  

## If new to RRF

If you've not used RRF or Duet boards before, a good resource of information can be found [here](https://docs.duet3d.com/User_manual/Overview/Adapting).
